# Twitter Clone

üê¶ Twitter clone (called Twimba) built while learning essential JavaScript concepts through Frontend Developer Bootcamp on Scrimba.

This project was a combination of code-along and building big chunks of the app on my own through challenges set by the teacher.

While working on this project via [Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend), I learned/practiced some of the important JavaScript & HTML concepts:

- `textarea`
- `.forEach()`
- data attributes
- conditionally render styles
- NOT operator `!`
- CDNs - add icons & generate UUIDs
